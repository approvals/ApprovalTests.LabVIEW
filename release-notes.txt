- Added ability to specify approval file. Useful if several tests should all produce the same results. As an example I added this feature for blue because I wanted to support long and short cli options. -l and --list should both produce the samething. I didn't want to have to maintain separate approval files for each test and run the risk that perhaps they would diverge and I wouldn't notice.
- Also added a decorator to allow for combining a folder and shared approval files.
